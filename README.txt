July 8, 2020- Spanish PUP Survey approved to go live and published survey link on website this morning. Spanish PUP Survey included shortened survey and moving panas_1_continue to "participant" on redcap. Found issue on Spanish PUP with branching logic on pbq (first for variables on the Child 1 block had been deleted, branching logic starting with item 17-20 did not work). Fixed Spanish PUP REDCap and submitted changes at 1:46 pm. FIRST THREE PARTICIPANTS IN DATA WERE PILOTS BY A MEMBER OF OUR RESEARCH TEAM (PUP 1,2,3 OF SPANISH PUP); last ppt before changes were approved was 3 so no real participants yet.
